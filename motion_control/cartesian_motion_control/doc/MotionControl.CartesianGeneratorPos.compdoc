This class implements a TaskContext that creates a path in Cartesian
space between the current cartesian position and a new desired
cartesian position. It uses trapezoidal velocity-profiles for every
dof using a maximum velocity and a maximum acceleration. It generates
frame and twist setpoints which can be used by
MotionControl::CartesianControllerPos,
MotionControl::CartesianControllerPosVel or
MotionControl::CartesianControllerVel.
