Motion Control Stack
====================

This stack contains components for joint and cartesian space motion
control.


History and Acknowledgement
---------------------------

The oldest components in this motion_control stack were developed
almost 10 years ago (as of 2012) by Klaas Gadeyne and Wim Meussen
(according to in-line comments). After the Orocos OCL library was
reduced to contain only infrastructure during the RTTv2 transition,
this code was adopted under the name motion_control and ported to
RTT-v2 by and Markus Klotzbuecher and Ruben Smits.
