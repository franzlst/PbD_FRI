Elements of the release
=======================

KUKALWR_Kinematics
------------------
 *   This class defines the kinematic transformations on the KUKA LWR Robot
 *
 *   The Forward Kinematics transformation considers the whole 7 DOF of the
 *   robot, while the Inverse Kinematics only calculates 6 Joints, setting
 *   the extra DOF to zero. This allows us to obtain a closed-form solution
 *   for the inverse kinematics.
 *
 *   The equations of this closed-form solution are based on the IK of an
 *   anthropomorphic arm with a spherical wrist given in the book
 *   "Robotics - Modelling, Planning and Control", by Siciliano et al. (2010)
 *   Only one of the four possible solutions for the kinematic
 *   chain is calculated. Specifically, the right-shoulder elbow-up one.
